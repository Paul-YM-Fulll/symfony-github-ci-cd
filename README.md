## Get started

### Install symfony project

To install a Symfony project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
make docker-install
```

This command will install the necessary dependencies and set up a Docker container for your project.

### Access the Symfony project

Once the installation is complete, you can access the project in your web browser at http://0.0.0.0:8080/.

### Access the container shell

If you need to access the shell of the Docker container, you can do so by running the following command:

```bash
make docker-sh
```

This will give you access to the container's command line interface.
